					Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece
					of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
					McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the
					more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the
					cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
					comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes
					of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.$

					This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
					first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
					1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for
					those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by
					Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions
					from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
